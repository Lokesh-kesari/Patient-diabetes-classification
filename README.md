# Patient Diabetes Classification Project

## Overview

This project aims to classify patients into two categories: diabetic or non-diabetic, based on various health-related features. The classification model is built using machine learning techniques to assist in diagnosing diabetes among patients.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains various features related to patients' health, such as glucose levels, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), etc. Along with these features, each instance in the dataset is labeled as either diabetic or non-diabetic.

## Approach

### Step 1: Data Loading and Preprocessing

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn import svm
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('diabetes_dataset.csv')

# Check for missing values
missing_values = dataset.isnull().sum()
print("Missing Values:\n", missing_values)

# Handling missing values if any
# Option 1: Drop rows with missing values
# dataset.dropna(inplace=True)

# Option 2: Impute missing values
# Replace missing values with mean, median, or mode
# dataset.fillna(dataset.mean(), inplace=True)

# Separate features and target variable
X = dataset.drop('diabetic', axis=1)
y = dataset['diabetic']

# Split data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Feature scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

###Step 2: Model Training and Evaluation
# Initialize SVM classifier
classifier = svm.SVC(kernel='linear')

# Train the classifier
classifier.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Predictions on test data
y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test_scaled)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)

Conclusion
In this project, we've successfully trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic based on health-related features. The accuracy of the model on the test set indicates its performance in diagnosing diabetes among patients.

Make sure to replace 'diabetes_dataset.csv' with the actual filename containing your dataset. Additionally, consider experimenting with different preprocessing techniques and machine learning algorithms to further improve the model's performance.
